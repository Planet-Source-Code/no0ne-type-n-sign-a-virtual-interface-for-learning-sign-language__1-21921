### Description

This is a BETA version 0.2. I have uploaded the latest copy.

<p>

It sports a virtual point and click keyboard. By ether hitting a key or typing directly into the console, Type-n-sign will then show the appropriate hand sign. Has play back, continuous play, and Speed control features. Even supports the ability to switch out hand modules (Have a Web or Digital Cam? Customize/personalize Type-N-sign to your needs...) Current module was created using poser.

[I take no responsibility for friends helping friends cheat on spelling test using this knowledge....]

Technical Notes::

<br>

Type-n-sign uses a transparent form based on the background picture (Pure API). The latest version loads its' data from a file (Program loads in under a second now. Thanks Doug) and if the data file isn't found it will create a new one. Since it is a transparent form, I relied on Popup menus and a graphical interface based on the picture itself. Also moved code from module to a class. Reads and writes to ini file as needed. (Checks to see if program is running for the first time, if so, sets a default file and brings up Options window.)

<p>

Please read the README.txt for further information
